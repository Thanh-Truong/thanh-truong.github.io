# GROW

## Goal
* Which question, issue would you like to talk about today ?
* What do you want or what do you want instead ?
* When you achieve that, what will that make for you ?
* How do you know when you have achieved that ?

## Reality
* What is missing, lacking, for you to reach that goal ?
* What resources or support do you need ?
* What stops you from ... ?
* Where are you now on a scale from 1 to 10 in reaching this goal / expected results ?

## Options
* What are the alternatives ?
* In what different ways could you approach this challenge ?
* What would you do if you had more time/a bigger budget / if you were the manager ?
* What advise would you give to a friend ?
* What else ?

## Will
* What is your next step ?
* What is your commitment for doing it 1-10 ?
* How can you get closer to 10 ?
* What can stop you and what can you do to prevent it ?

# Observer instructions

Things to pay extra attention to:
* 1. Does the coach help the coachee to elaborate and to be specific ?
* 2. Does the coach take time to listen and pay attention to what's " below the surface" ?
* 3. Does the coach take on too much responsibility for the solution ?
