## Start with a compliment then ask for a favour

Someone gives you a compliment on anything

- you are a very good developer
- you are fast in fixing bugs
- you are talented when it comes to making dashboards

Then he or she asks you to something which is always import but it is out of context or it is adhoc requirement without any detailed planning. Usually, it is urgent for the requestor and he or she wants it to be finished soon as possible like 5 PM today or tomorrow morning.

What would you do ? Would you say yes or would you say no ?

*Counter strategy*
- Saying No
- Saying Yes with asking for help

## Ignore the presenter

Someone enters to the meeting room with a wandered mind and pays all attentions to his or her phone rather than giving the presenter a deserved concentration to start/continue.

This is warning of non-inclusive culture at your workplace. It goes beyond etiquette or individual's social behaviour and can lead to harassment.  

*Counter strategy*
- Be transparent 
- And ask for help to get started

## Double bind
A situtation in which you is confronted with two irreconcilable demands or a choice between two undesirable courses of action.

Examples:
- It is late and you need to pick up kids from school but you still can finish this report before you go ? asked your manager

*Counter strategy*
- Be transparent 
- And ask for help
