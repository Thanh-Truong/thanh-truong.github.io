I am a software developer and a former database researcher whose passion is building data-intensive applications.

I am currently working as Engineering Manager at Savings Offering department, [SEB](https://seb.se/), Stockholm. My primary responsibilities include working on and implementing the technical roadmap for how we want to make data available within the Savings & Investments area, and collaborating with architects and developers. I enjoy coaching more junior colleagues, recruiting and building teams of data engineers, and sofware developers. 

From September 2020 to September 2021, I worked as Senior Data Engineer/Solution Architect at [H&M Group](https://hmgroup.com/). There, I collaboratively worked with Microsoft architects and developers to design and build a next generation of big dataplatform for entire H&M Group. My contributions lie mainly data processing and data governance domains of the platform.

Previously, I worked at [TV4](https://www.tv4.se/) and [CMore](https://www.cmore.se) sas successor from a Database Engineer Research position at [Starcounter AB](https://starcounter.com) working on a query optimizer. Prior to this, I spent several years at [Uppsala University](https://www.uu.se/), Sweden as database researcher and (assistant) lecturer . Before pursuing research in university, I worked as software developer at Mobile Art, [Elca](https:///www.elca.vn), and [FPT](https://www.fpt-software.com/) since 2005 building desktop applications and web applications.

I am not quite a methodical runner yet despite that I run 5 days per week all year round. My source of inspirations and tips are from [Sverige springer](https://www.sverigespringer.se/).

Recently, I have picked up on writing technical notes again. Among them, a few notes here were revived from my old Wordpress blog in between 2009 - 20016.

If it was not enough to keep me busy! I am also a father of twin girls and married to a wonderful wife.

You can reach me via email as I am always open to interesting conversations and collaboration.
