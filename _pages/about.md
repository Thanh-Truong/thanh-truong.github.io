I am a software developer and a former database researcher whose passion is building data-intensive applications.

I am currently working as Senior Data Engineer (self-proclaimed
 Data Magician) at [H&M Group](https://hmgroup.com/), which owns several fashion brands including H&M, Arket, Weekday, COS, Monki, H&M Home, &Other Stories, and AFound.

Previously, I worked at [TV4](https://www.tv4.se/) and [CMore](https://www.cmore.se) as Data Engineer as successor from a Database Engineer Research position at [Starcounter AB](https://starcounter.com) working on a query optimizer. Prior to this, I spent several years at [Uppsala University](https://www.uu.se/), Sweden as database researcher. Before pursuiting research in university, I worked as software developer at Mobile Art, [Elca](https:///www.elca.vn), and [FPT](https://www.fpt-software.com/) since 2005 building desktop applications and web applications.

I am not quite a methodical runner yet despite that I run 5 days per week all year round. My source of inspirations and tips are from [Sverige springer](https://www.sverigespringer.se/).

Recently, I have picked up on writing technical notes again. They are [here](/year-archive/). Among them, a few notes here were revived from my old Wordpress blog in between 2009 - 20016.

If it was not enough to keep me busy! I am also a father of twin grils and married to a wonderful wife.  

I am best reached via email as I’m always open to interesting conversations and collaboration.
