I am a software developer and a former database researcher whose passion is building data-intensive applications.

I am currently working as Lead Cloud Data Engineer at [SEB](https://seb.se/), Stockholm. As responsibilities, I work with domain architect on a roadmap to build services towards Google Cloud Platform and realize the roadmap with my team. I am also mentoring and coaching others in my team. 

From September 2020 to September 2021, I worked as Senior Data Engineer (Data Magician) at [H&M Group](https://hmgroup.com/), which owns several fashion brands including [H&M](https://www2.hm.com/sv_se/index.html), [Arket](https://www.arket.com/en_sek/index.html), [Weekday](https://www.weekday.com/en_sek/index.html), [COS](https://www.cosstores.com/en_sek/index.html), [Monki](https://www.monki.com/en_sek/index.html), [H&M Home](https://www2.hm.com/sv_se/home.html), [&Other Stories](https://www.stories.com/), and [AFound](https://www.afound.com/). There, I collaboratively worked with Microsoft to develop a next generation of big dataplatform for entire H&M Group. I contributed mainly to architecture and design of data processing and data governance domains of the platform.

Previously, I worked at [TV4](https://www.tv4.se/) and [CMore](https://www.cmore.se) as Data Engineer as successor from a Database Engineer Research position at [Starcounter AB](https://starcounter.com) working on a query optimizer. Prior to this, I spent several years at [Uppsala University](https://www.uu.se/), Sweden as database researcher. Before pursuing research in university, I worked as software developer at Mobile Art, [Elca](https:///www.elca.vn), and [FPT](https://www.fpt-software.com/) since 2005 building desktop applications and web applications.

I am not quite a methodical runner yet despite that I run 5 days per week all year round. My source of inspirations and tips are from [Sverige springer](https://www.sverigespringer.se/).

Recently, I have picked up on writing technical notes again. They are [here](/year-archive/). Among them, a few notes here were revived from my old Wordpress blog in between 2009 - 20016.

If it was not enough to keep me busy! I am also a father of twin girls and married to a wonderful wife.

You can reach me via email as I am always open to interesting conversations and collaboration.
